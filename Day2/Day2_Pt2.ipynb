It increases your depth by your aim multiplied by X. Again note that since you're on a submarine, down and up do the opposite of what you might expect: \"down\" means aiming in the positive direction.\n",

    "    forward 8 adds 8 to your horizontal position, a total of 13. Because your aim is 5, your depth increases by 8*5=40.\n",
    "    up 3 decreases your aim by 3, resulting in a value of 2.\n",
    "    down 8 adds 8 to your aim, resulting in a value of 10.\n",

    "Using this new interpretation of the commands, calculate the horizontal position and depth you would have after following the planned course. What do you get if you multiply your final horizontal position by your final depth?\n"
